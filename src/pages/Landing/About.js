          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            A small team of individuals with experience in the education sector,
            with a passion for solving problems faced by students and educators.

            We believe that 'software type' software should be cost-effective,
            easy to use, and allow for infinite reusability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team members have worked as collegiate professors, software
            engineers in the education technology space, etc.

            One thing that we noticed when creating assignments for students, is
            the lack of depth to some of the existing solutions. We decided to
            put together MyStudyBook as a way improve the quality of life of
            educators and students alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            MyStudyBook provides significant customization to coursework, etc..
